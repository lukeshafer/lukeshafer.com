My personal portfolio - _you're looking at it!_ I have had many websites over the years, using various platforms and technologies. As I've started doing some freelance work, I wanted to re-build my site from scratch with this focus in mind.

### Website Technology

After working on a client project in Svelte, I realized I loved working with it and wanted to further explore what it can do. I had some trouble with the Rollup configuration the previous project used, so I switched my framework to SvelteKit to get a more opinionated structure to my project, so I could spend less time configuring and more time building.

With my site, I made sure to focus on building a sound structure for the future. I used clearly structured, semantic HTML, and made sure the content of the site was accessible to screen readers.

I have a lot in mind for the future of my site, including new color schemes and fun interactive projects, games, and more! While it's mostly a portfolio of past work
