## guardiansofheart.org

Guardians of Heart is a nonprofit organization dedicated to giving children the opportunity to meet their heroes. Volunteers dress as famous characters from fairy tales and comic books and visit families in need in the Central Ohio region.

### Origins

I helped found Guardians of Heart after a similar character volunteer organization disbanded in June 2020, around the same time as the Black Lives Matter protests surrounding George Floyd’s death. The leadership in this previous group was unwilling to publicly speak out against racism, and ultimately shut down the nonprofit as a result.

A group of former members, myself included, formed Guardians of Heart with a focus on inclusiveness and justice. We made a group which would speak out against injustice, especially as a group serving lower-income families or children of color in the Columbus region.

Last year, my wife bought the game [Ransom Notes](https://www.veryspecialgames.com/products/ransom-notes-the-ridiculous-word-magnet-game), but most of our friends are internet friends so we haven't been able to play it much! So I decided to take it into my own hands and make my own version to play with friends! For legal purposes, I wanted to give it its own name, and thus **Fridge Magnets** was born!

I've never made an online multiplayer game, so learning how to manage game state between players and keep it synchronized was a challenge. Luckily, I found [Colyseus](https://www.colyseus.io/), a Node.js-based game server! The frontend is Sveltekit, which you could have probably guessed if you've read about my past projects!

We chose Squarespace primarily because we wanted to focus our time and energy on building the business and organization, and because I am the only developer on the team and had a limited amount of time to work on the site.
