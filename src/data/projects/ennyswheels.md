# [enny.fund](https://enny.fund/)

I participated in a fundraiser to raise a goal of $2500 for our friend Enny, who is waiting on the transplant list for a new liver. I volunteered to make the website for the donation drive, as I felt having a dedicated website for the cause would be valuable and easy to share.

## Website Technology

I knew the main purpose of this site would be to direct people to the Chuffed.org fundraiser page, so I wanted to bring a unique visual design along with various options for donating, all in a single page. For this reason, I chose SvelteKit as I'd used it for a few projects at this point, and I knew I could throw a site together in a day or two.

Svelte also allowed me to easily and quickly add animations to the clouds as the user scrolled down the page. I wanted to bring a touch of professionalism and artistry, as this fundraiser was just run by an online community of people, and not a major organization.

If I had to choose something to improve with this project, it would be the responsiveness on the heading. Since this fundraiser moved very quickly, my main goal was to get something online quickly. On most devices, the site looks great, but there are cropping issues occasionally with the photo of Enny at the page heading.
