## onoturoturo.com

Ono Turo-Turo is a Hawaiian-Filipino fusion food truck in Gahanna, Ohio. They were my first client project for my freelancing business.

### Website Technology

[onoturoturo.com](https://onoturoturo.com/) is built using Svelte, based on [the Svelte repository](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte). I chose Svelte as an opportunity to learn a new framework. A lot of my previous personal work used plain old HTML and CSS, plus JQuery. I wanted to move away from JQuery as I know it is a bit outdated, and considered Svelte and React for this site. I ultimately went with Svelte because I have used React in the past and wanted a chance to learn something new.

The client said that they wanted something fairly simple that they can update easily and wouldn't have a monthly cost. Therefore, I chose to use Netlify CMS for the backend, which is a Git-based CMS. This means that instead of using databases or APIs, everything works out of JSON files directly on the repository. I chose this because it's fully open source and free, and there wouldn't be any hosting costs.

To host the site, I chose Netlify because it pairs well with Netlify CMS, and their free tier would be more than enough to cover Ono Turo-Turo's needs.
