# [Fridge Magnets](https://fridge.dev.lukeshafer.com/)

## (name in progress)

Last year, my wife bought the game [Ransom Notes](https://www.veryspecialgames.com/products/ransom-notes-the-ridiculous-word-magnet-game), but most of our friends are internet friends so we haven't been able to play it much! So I decided to take it into my own hands and make my own version to play with friends! For legal purposes, I wanted to give it its own name, and thus **Fridge Magnets** was born!

I've never made an online multiplayer game, so learning how to manage game state between players and keep it synchronized was a challenge. Luckily, I found [Colyseus](https://www.colyseus.io/), a Node.js-based game server! The frontend is Sveltekit, which you could have probably guessed if you've read about my past projects!

This has been a fun challenge (though not complete yet), and I've learned a lot through it. I'm excited to start playtesting with friends!
